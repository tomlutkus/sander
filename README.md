## These are the scripts which I produced from taking Sander's course from O'Reilly
### Bash Shell Scripting 2nd Edition, Sander van Vugt

Some scripts might be nearly identical to the scripts written by Sander, but only insofar as I ended up pursuing the same solution as he did.
I will normally write my own scripts from scratch, no matter how trivial they might be, as I think no written line of code will ever go to
waste. The more practice that we get, the more certain concepts will become second nature.

I will keep referring to these scripts to improve my skills and I might revisit some of them as I get better. Please feel free to look at them
and fork what's in here. I will also revisit this README document and add things to it as I see fit, because I also believe that improving my
Git and GitHub skills is never wasteful, and learning the markup language is great to enable myself to produce great documentation.
