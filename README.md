### Learning shell scripting with Sander
**Bash Shell Scripting 2nd Edition, Sander van Vugt**

Some scripts might be nearly identical to the scripts written by Sander, but only insofar as I ended up pursuing the same solution as he did.
I will normally write my own scripts from scratch, no matter how trivial they might be, as I think no written line of code will ever go to
waste. The more practice that we get, the more certain concepts will become second nature.

I will keep referring to these scripts to improve my skills and I might revisit some of them as I get better. Please feel free to look at them
and fork what's in here. I will also revisit this README document and add things to it as I see fit, because I also believe that improving my
Git and GitHub skills is never wasteful, and learning the markup language is great to enable myself to produce great documentation.

All the scripts contained here are bash scripts. I chose not to add the .sh extension to them, but that's just a personal choice for this
particular repo, it doesn't mean that this is how I roll.

This is all done under Sander's guidance and all credits belong to him. Do check out his course on www.oreilly.com if you also want to learn shell scripting!
